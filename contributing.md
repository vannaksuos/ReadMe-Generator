Steps for creating good issues or pull requests.
Links to external documentation, mailing lists, or a code of conduct.
Community and behavioral expectations.
At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one author in the commit message. For more information, see "Creating a commit with multiple co-authors."

Commit message for your change
Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is master, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request. For more information, see "Creating a new pull request."
